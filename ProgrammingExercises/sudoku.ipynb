    "### Recursive Backtracking Algorithm for Solving Sudoku --- the main problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Your final task is to implement a recursive, backtracking-based function that solves a partially filled Sudoku grid. Conceptually, this algorithm is very similar to the one we discussed for the $n$-queens problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function, `solve_sudoku`, should take two arguments:\n",
    "- `sudoku` — a partially filled Sudoku grid\n",
    "- `pos` — the current position (cell) to consider\n",
    "  \n",
    "You may assume that all cells before `pos` are already filled with valid digits. Some cells at or after `pos` may still be empty. The goal of the function is to fill in the remaining cells so that the grid becomes a complete, valid Sudoku solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "**Algorithm Outline**\n",
    "1. **Base Case:**\n",
    "If `pos` refers to a location beyond the last cell of the grid, it means we have successfully filled the entire Sudoku. In this case, simply return the completed grid as the solution.\n",
    "2. **Skip Pre-Filled Cells:**\n",
    "If the cell at `pos` is already filled (i.e., non-zero in our representation), there’s nothing to do at this position. Recursively call `solve_sudoku(sudoku, next_pos(pos))` to continue solving from the next cell.\n",
    "3. **Try Possible Digits:**\n",
    "If the cell at pos is empty, first obtain the list of digits that can validly be placed there by calling `get_available_digits(sudoku, pos)`.\n",
    "Then:\n",
    "    - For each candidate digit `d` in that list:\n",
    "        1. Place `d` in the cell at pos.\n",
    "        2. Recursively call `solve_sudoku(sudoku, next_pos(pos))`.\n",
    "        3. If this recursive call returns a valid solution, propagate that solution upward (return it immediately).\n",
    "    - If none of the candidate digits lead to a valid solution, reset the cell to empty and backtrack.\n",
    "---\n",
    "This recursive exploration systematically tries every valid possibility, backing up whenever it reaches a dead end. Eventually, it either returns a complete, consistent Sudoku grid or determines that no solution exists."
