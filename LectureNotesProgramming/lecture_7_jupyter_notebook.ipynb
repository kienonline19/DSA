    "Let us now write the main function that calculates the number of valid positions of $n$ queens on an $n\\times n$ chess board. On a first glance, it is not obvious how such a function should work - we have learned about recursion, but there is no obvious recursive structure here: even if we knot all valid configurations of $n-1$ queens on $n-1\\times n-1$ chessboard, this doesn't help us to solve the problem on $n\\times n$ chess board.\n",

    "The key idea is to **generalize** the problem. Note first that in every configuration of non-attacking queens, clearly there is at most one queen in each row. Since we are attempting to count positions of $n$ queens on $n \\times n$ chessboard, every valid configuration has exactly one queen on each row.\n",

    "We will use this observation, and write a function that takes the size of the chessboard $n$, and a list `positions`, of some $k$ non-attacking queens in the first $k$ rows; the function is supposed to count in how many ways we can extend those $k$ queens to a full valid configuration of $n$ queens (where a position is \"valid\" if none of the queens is attacking any other).\n",

    "\n",
    "The benefit of stating a problem this way is that it now has a very clear recursive structure: to calculate in how many ways we can extend a given list `poistions` to a full configuration, we first check if the number of queens already placed is $n$ --- in which case there is only one \"extension\" -- the position is already valid, and we do not need to do anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the number of queens already placed $k$ is strictly smaller than $n$, we try to place the $k+1$-st queen in each of $n$ possible locations. For a potential placement $(k,i)$ of the last queen, we first check if it is not attacking any of the previous queens in the list, if it is not --- we append its position it to the list `position` and call the function `queens(n, positions + [(k,i)])` - recursively calculating in how many ways this list can be extended to a full configuration. We sum those outputs over all potential positions for the $k+1$-st queen, and return the result as a number of valid extensions of the given list `position`.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this stage, when iterating over all posisble positions $i$ for the $k+1$-st queen using the `for` loop, we realize that we would like to check whether the queen at position $(k, i)$ is attacking any of the already placed queens in the list `positions`. Since this is a relatively self-contained task, that would add some complexity, let us not worry about it for now: let's pretend that a function `is_valid_extension` is already written, and use call this function in the code below. We will implement this function a bit later.\n",
    "\n",
    "By ignoring the implementation of the function `is_valid_extension` for now, the implementation of the main function itself is relatively simple recursion, not too much different than the previous recursive function we wrote to list all possible subsets of the set $\\{0, \\ldots, n-1\\}$."
