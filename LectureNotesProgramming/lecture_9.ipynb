The correct answer there should be `left`, but the condition `if arr[mid] > arr[left]: left = mid+1` is not the right condition while we are in the sorted part of the array. We should either compare with the right endpoint, as in `find_shift_attempt_3`, or more explicitly just check in each iteration of the loop, if `arr[left] < arr[right]` --- if this is the case, we know that the subarray between `left` and `right` is sorted, so the minimum element is `left`."
